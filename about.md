## Supporting those in need, one step at a time

KindBoost is created with one simple mission: To be the avenue for anyone looking for someone to talk to, about anything at all. We would be glad to listen to your bouts of depression, loneliness, sexual issues, etc. We value you as an individual and would love to have you join our wonderful community of like-minded sufferers.

This site offers you one thing: The need to chat with others who are willing to listen. It does NOT however, serve as a suicide crisis line, and the listening service is NOT served by professional therapists and psychiatrists. If you or any close one whom you know are suicidal, please refer to your national suicide care line:

* Malaysia: [Befrienders](http://www.befrienders.org.my/service.html)
* Singapore: [Samaritans of Singapore](https://sos.org.sg/contact-us)
